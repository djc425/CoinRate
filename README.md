# CoinRate
Crypto exchange rates across a number of currencies and coins

CoinRate is a project based off the tutorial project from Angela Yu's iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp on Udemy. I decided to rewrite this project using a programmatic layout and adding more crypto and world currencies by making use of two UIPickerViews. 

In this project I make a call to the coinapi.io currency exchange rate api and return the data for 11 crypto currencies and 11 world currencies. My goal here was to make a clean and easy to understand layout where a user can intuitively know to scroll the wheels to see the current exchance rate per coin in the UILabel at the top.
